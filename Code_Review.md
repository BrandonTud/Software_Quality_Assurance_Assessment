# Importance of Code Reviews in Software Development

In the IT world, code reviews are very important for improving code quality and encouraging collaboration between developers. Code review is the practice of going back over one's code to find bugs or problems to improve or correct it. Within a team, the person carrying out the code review is often not the author of the code, enabling an external opinion and validation by multiple people. As this article shows, code reviews are essential in companies where teams work together.

"Code reviews play a pivotal role in ensuring the quality, reliability, and maintainability of software projects. By fostering a culture of collaboration, sharing knowledge, and maintaining coding standards, teams can harness the full potential of code reviews to deliver high-quality software products."

A study shows that when developers know their code will be reviewed by a teammate, they produce more thorough work and ensure that their code passes all the automatic tests. As this article shows, "When developers know their code will be reviewed by a teammate, they make an extra effort to ensure that all tests are passing and the code is as well-designed as they can make it so the review will go smoothly."

In the software development process, code reviews are very important for producing clean code that is understood by the whole team. To ensure that the process is as clear as possible, the simplest way is to assign the people who will review each person's code in advance when planning the tasks. As soon as a task has been completed, the person responsible for reviewing the code can then get to work, as this article suggests: "after all the code has been written and automated tests have been run and passed-but before the code is merged upstream" [Source](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/software-development/code-reviews#:~:text=Code%20reviews%20should%20integrate%20with,the%20code%20is%20merged%20upstream.)

During a code review, the simplest thing to do is to create a code standard within the team beforehand so that the person reviewing the code can easily understand it. If the code is still technical and complicated to understand despite the existence of a code standard, the author can add comments. Firstly, this will speed up the code review, and secondly, if another developer has to work on this part of the code in the future, it will be easier for them to understand it.

During a code review, it is still important to offer constructive criticism of the code. Never offer personal criticism or anything else, as this would damage group cohesion and therefore the team's performance, which is not the desired aim. Feedback must be clear, constructive, and specific. This will enable everyone to improve and thus increase the team's overall productivity in developing an application. To back up my comments, we can look at the practices recommended by GitHub: "In general, it is important to be courteous and respectful while also being very clear and helpful to the developer whose code you are reviewing. One way to do this is to be sure that you are always making comments about the code and never making comments about the developer."
