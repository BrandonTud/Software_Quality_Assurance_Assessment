# Summary

Our company's commitment to excellence in software development is evident through the implementation of various best practices described in our manual. These practices include effective task estimation in Scrum, with a focus on relative estimation techniques, task decomposition, risk management, iterative improvement, and bias avoidance. By following these guidelines, we can improve the accuracy of project planning, which improves predictability and successful deliveries.

Moreover, our adoption of Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) principles ensures streamlined development processes, rapid problem detection, and efficient application deployment. This approach not only accelerates the software development lifecycle but also maintains high standards of quality and stability, allowing for rapid delivery of functionality to end-users.

Furthermore, the focus on code revisions as a cornerstone of our development process underscores our commitment to maintaining code quality, fostering collaboration, and meeting coding standards. Establishing clear review processes, defining code standards, providing constructive feedback, and maintaining a respectful environment are critical to ensuring our codebase remains clean, understandable, and conducive to team productivity.
