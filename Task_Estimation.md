# Handbook Content - Task Estimation in Scrum

**Introduction:** Task estimation is a fundamental aspect of Scrum methodology, essential for planning and executing projects effectively. Through research and analysis of various resources, we've identified key insights and best practices to improve task estimation accuracy within our team.

## **The main axes:**

1. **Importance of Relative Estimation:** Most resources emphasize the value of relative estimation techniques such as Planning Poker. These methods focus on comparing the relative size or effort of tasks rather than estimating absolute time or complexity. By involving the entire team in the estimation process, diverse perspectives are considered, leading to more accurate estimations.

2. **Break Tasks into Smaller Units:** Breaking down tasks into smaller, more manageable units is consistently highlighted as a best practice. Smaller tasks are easier to estimate accurately and provide greater visibility into project progress. This approach also allows for better risk management and enables the team to adapt more efficiently to changes in requirements.

3. **Accounting for Uncertainty:** A recurring theme is the importance of accounting for uncertainty and risk during task estimation. Teams are encouraged to add buffer time or contingency plans to accommodate unexpected challenges or delays. By acknowledging and mitigating uncertainties upfront, teams can avoid underestimation and better manage stakeholder expectations.

4. **Regular Review and Adaptation:** Continuous improvement is emphasized across all resources, emphasizing the need for regular review and adaptation of estimation practices. Teams are encouraged to track their performance, evaluate the accuracy of past estimations, and adjust their approach accordingly. This iterative process helps teams refine their estimation techniques over time and improve overall predictability.

5. **Avoiding Biases:** Resources caution against common biases that can affect estimation accuracy, such as anchoring bias. Providing initial estimates before team discussions or being influenced by previous estimations can skew results. Encouraging open and collaborative discussions during estimation sessions helps mitigate these biases and leads to more objective estimations.

## **Key Guidelines:**

- **Use Relative Estimation Techniques:** Embrace methods like Planning Poker to involve the entire team and leverage diverse perspectives for more accurate estimations.

- **Break Tasks into Smaller Units:** Decompose tasks into smaller, more manageable units to improve accuracy and visibility into project progress.

- **Account for Uncertainties:** Incorporate buffer time or contingency plans to address uncertainties and mitigate risks during estimation.

- **Regularly Review and Adjust:** Continuously evaluate past estimations, track team performance, and adjust estimation techniques based on feedback and historical data.

- **Avoid Biases:** Foster an environment of open discussion and collaboration to prevent biases like anchoring bias from impacting estimation accuracy.
